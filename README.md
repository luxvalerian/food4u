# Foodle

## Introduction
Foodle is a volunteer powdered grocery delivery app, as inspired by covid-19. Foodle will allow users to select groceries from certain stores, pay for them (set a delivery, connect to a volunteer). 
Users will log on to a website, select a grocery store, pick their items, put them in a cart and checkout. In our current state of covid-19, social distancing has made it difficult for the elderly to buy groceries without taking significant risk. We wanted to create an app where a person could order groceries from a store, and have them delivered by a volunteer.
