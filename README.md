# Foodle
Foodle is a grocery delivery app, as inspired by covid-19. Foodle will allow users to select groceries from certain stores, pay for them (set a delivery, connect to a volunteer). Users will log on to a website, select a grocery store, pick their items, put them in a cart and checkout.


## Motivation
In our current state of covid-19, social distancing has made it difficult for the elderly to buy groceries in a timely manner.  We wanted to create an app where a person could order groceries from a store, and have them delivered by a volunteer.

## Build status
Building. This is a student project, made by Galata, Vincent and William, who are students in SEIR-FLEX-Bladerunner from General Assembly.
